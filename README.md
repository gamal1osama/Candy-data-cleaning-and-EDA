# Candy Data Cleaning and EDA

This repository contains a data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on candy survey data. The data was collected through a survey that asked people about their taste preferences in chocolate before Halloween.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to perform data cleaning and EDA on the survey data to gain insights into people's favorite and least favorite chocolates. After cleaning the data, the goal is to display the top 10 most loved and most hated chocolates.

## Files in the Repository

- **candyhierarchy.pdf**: The original survey document used to collect the data.
- **candyhierarchy2017.xlsx**: The Excel file containing the survey responses.
- **Candy notebook.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data cleaning and EDA.

## Steps Performed

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Standardized and normalized chocolate names for consistency.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
